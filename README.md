- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on testing how well a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10021-018-0226-4">recently developed model of lake primary production</a> holds up when confronted with lake metabolism estimates from 60 globally-distributed <a href="https://gleon.org/">GLEON sites</a>. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to <a href="https://microcollaborative.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MP/overview">analyze data sets using regularized regression</a> to gain a better understanding of the processes underpinning variability in water quality through space and time.
